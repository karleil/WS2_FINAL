Web Scripting 2 - Final Project

Libraries Installed:

- React Burger Menu - npm install react-burger-menu --save
- React Router Dom - npm install react-router-dom
- Tailwind CSS - npm install tailwindcss@latest postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest --save npx tailwindcss init -p

To start the project, run the following:

cd apiProject
npm install
npm run dev

Challenges:

- I spent hours looking for an api that is free but also provides rich text numbers like descriptions but most of them are just one to two sentences.
- Also had trouble understanding the concept of calling the api (had to use ChatGPT as a teacher).
- Used the one given to us in Quiz 2 instead.
